# NVIDIA Model Deployment – TensorFlow Example

This project demonstrates deploying a simple TensorFlow model using the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) lab environment.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Built and trained a basic TensorFlow model using Keras `Sequential` API.
- Saved the trained model in **SavedModel format** under `models/simple-tensorflow-model/1`.
- Ran inference using dummy input data and verified model predictions.
- Organized and uploaded the model files to GitHub for showcasing.
